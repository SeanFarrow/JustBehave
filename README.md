JustBehave is a small .NET library that helps you structure your C# tests into BDD-style contexts and scenarios.
It supports both **NUnit** and **XUnit** and depends on **AutoFixture** for automatic dependency construction using your mocking framework of choice.

JustBehave was written to ensure that our internal tests followed a consistent and sane BDD pattern, without relying on frameworks like SpecFlow and the Gherkin language. Tests written using JustBehave are structured and organised, without requiring additional tooling or plugins.
		

## Installation

Pre-requisites: The project is built in .net v4.0.

* From source: https://github.com/justeat/JustBehave
* By hand: https://www.nuget.org/packages/JustBehave

Via NuGet:

		PM> Install-Package JustBehave


## Getting Started

Once you have the package installed into your test project, along with your test framework of choice, a standard JustBehave test file will look like this using XUnit:
```csharp
	//public class TestClassNamedAfterABddContext : XBehaviourTest<TheClassThatIWantToTest> // XUnit
	public class TestClassNamedAfterABddContext : BehaviourTest<TheClassThatIWantToTest> // NUnit
	{
		private string _input;
		private string _result;

		protected override void Given()
		{
			_input = "my input";
		}

		protected override void When()
		{
			_result = SystemUnderTest.CallingAMethod(_input);
		}

		[Then]
		public void ReturnsSomething()
		{
			_result.ShouldBe("something");
		}
	}
```
A full set of tested examples are provided in the repository in the project **JustBehave.Tests** in the **Examples** namespace.

### Important classes and attributes

The core of JustBehave is built upon a few small classes:

* `BehaviourTest` - inherited for an **NUnit** test
* `XBehaviourTest` - inherited for an **XUnit** test
* `ThenAttribute` - used to annotate your **Then** conditions for the nunit testing framework
  * when using xunit, use `FactAttribute` as normal

This leads to test classes that follow the convention:
```csharp
	public class TestClassNamedAfterABddContext : BehaviourTest<TheClassThatIWantToTest>
	{
		protected override void Given(){ /*...*/ }
		protected override void When(){ /*...*/ }
		[Then] public void Assertion1(){ /*...*/ }			
		[Then] public void Assertion2(){ /*...*/ }
	}
```
The NUnit `TestFixtureAttribute` is optional and implemented on the base of our NUnit BehaviourTest classes.

### Structuring Contexts and Scenarios

The core of JustBehave is a base class for your tests that enforces a **"Given, When, Then"** pattern. Each test file represents a single context with a *Given*, a *When*, and multiple *Then* assertions. 

Broader tests are constructed by **inheriting from previous test classes**, and overriding the *Given* or *When* steps, while adding additional *Then* conditions to construct scenarios. Expect to use namespaces to group related scenarios, while **giving your test classes names that represent their context**. 

For example, when testing some payment infrastructure, expect to end up with a set of files like this:

	/Tests/Payments/WhenIMakeAPayment.cs
	/Tests/Payments/AndMyPaymentIsRejected.cs (inherits from WhenIMakeAPayment.cs)
	/Tests/Payments/AndMyPaymentIsAccepted.cs (inherits from WhenIMakeAPayment.cs)
		
By following this style, you'll end up with a ReSharper test runner that looks like this:

### Handling and Testing Exceptions

If you want to assert on thrown exceptions, you setup your Given() step like this:
```csharp
	protected override void Given()
	{
	    RecordAnyExceptionsThrown();
	}
```		
Any exceptions thrown will then be available in your Then steps for you to assert on:
```csharp        
	[Then]
	public void ShouldSeeException()
	{
		ThrownException.ShouldBeTypeOf<NotSupportedException>();
	}
```	
### Testing classes with dependencies

In order for JustBehave to construct your dependency graphs, you must either:

* Manually construct your system under test
* Configure AutoFixture and a mocking framework to auto-mock your dependencies
	
To override construction of the system under test, you need to override `CreateSystemUnderTest()` and return a valid instance:

```csharp
	protected override SomethingUnderTest CreateSystemUnderTest()
	{
		return new SomethingUnderTest();
	}
```	

Alternatively, to configure AutoFixture, you should override `CustomizeAutoFixture()` providing a valid `AutoFixture` customisation:

```csharp
	protected override void CustomizeAutoFixture(Fixture fixture)
	{
		fixture.Customize(new AutoRhinoMockCustomization());
		// You can add more customisations by adding the NuGet packages for
		// Ploeh.AutoFixture.Auto**PopularMockingFramework** and hooking them up
	}
```
